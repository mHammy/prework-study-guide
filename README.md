# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I was motivated to create this project to assist myself and potentially future bootcamp students to have access to notes regarding the bootcamp material.
This webpage acts as a source of knowledge from my experience. 
I learned basic HTML for setting up a foundation, CSS for adding visual appeal, JS for adding function to the webpage and utilizing Git for version control via a repository.
